  "readme": "Select2\n=================\n\nSelect2 is a jQuery based replacement for select boxes. It supports searching, remote data sets, and infinite scrolling of results. Look and feel of Select2 is based on the excellent [Chosen](http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/) library.\n\nTo get started -- checkout http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2!\n\nWhat Does Select2 Support That Chosen Does Not?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n* Working with large datasets: Chosen requires the entire dataset to be loaded as `option` tags in the DOM, which limits\nit to working with small-ish datasets. Select2 uses a function to find results on-the-fly, which allows it to partially\nload results.\n* Paging of results: Since Select2 works with large datasets and only loads a small amount of matching results at a time\nit has to support paging. Select2 will call the search function when the user scrolls to the bottom of currently loaded\nresult set allowing for the 'infinite scrolling' of results.\n* Custom markup for results: Chosen only supports rendering text results because that is the only markup supported by\n`option` tags. Select2 provides an extension point which can be used to produce any kind of markup to represent results.\n* Ability to add results on the fly: Select2 provides the ability to add results from the search term entered by the user, which allows it to be used for\ntagging.\n\nBrowser Compatibility\n--------------------\n* IE 8+ (7 mostly works except for [issue with z-index](https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/issues/37))\n* Chrome 8+\n* Firefox 3.5+\n* Safari 3+\n* Opera 10.6+\n\nIntegrations\n------------\n\n* [Wicket-Select2](https://github.com/ivaynberg/wicket-select2) (Java / Apache Wicket)\n* [select2-rails](https://github.com/argerim/select2-rails) (Ruby on Rails)\n* [AngularUI](http://angular-ui.github.com/#directives-select2) ([AngularJS](angularjs.org))\n* [Django](https://github.com/applegrew/django-select2)\n\nBug tracker\n-----------\n\nHave a bug?
